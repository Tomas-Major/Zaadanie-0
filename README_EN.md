B-OOP 2021

This is an ungraded, voluntary assignment. Its purpose is to allow you to try out the git version control system.

#### Tasks:
* Create your git repository from the assignment's template repository (this repository)
* Ensure that calling the _main_ method will result in the words "Hello world" being printed in the console (standard output)
* Save your changes into the VCS (commit) and upload them to your remote repository (push)
* If you completed the assignment the automated tests should pass
* If the tests didn't pass you can modify your solution and upload it again (commit + push)
* The last uploaded version at the moment of the deadline is automatically handed in
